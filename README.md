How this work. <br>
This script automaticaly creates a css with tansform property [ 0% { transform: translate(0px, 0px) rotate(0deg); }  to  100% { transform: translate(0px, 0px) rotate(0deg); } ]
as using this API you don't have to write every single percentage and degree from [0 to 100 & 100 to 0 ] to create pendulum effect.


----
How to Implement : 
1.Add jquery API [GOOGLE CDN or etc ]at the top of page [as shown in example]
   GOOGLE CDN - https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"

2.Add Grapdevs API at the very bottom of page or after the closing of body tag
   GrapDevs javascript  API - " Download /grap-javascript-api.js and host by your own. Script vailable in js folder" or 
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grapdevs/Pendulum-effect-using-jquery-css/master/js/grap-javascript-api.js - "NOT RECOMENDED"
  
    
3.Add class -> [ grap-pendu-l ] on the tag where you want to make a pendulum effect

Example -> <img class="grap-pendu-l" height="350px;"src="blahblah.jpg">

<h4>AND THAT"S ALL ;-)</h4>
