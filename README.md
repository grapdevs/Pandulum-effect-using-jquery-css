How this work. <br>
This script automaticaly creates a css with tansform property [ 0% { transform: translate(0px, 0px) rotate(0deg); }  to  100% { transform: translate(0px, 0px) rotate(0deg); } ]
as using this API you don't have to write every single percentage and degree from [0 to 100 & 100 to 0 ] to create pendulum effect.


----
How to Implement : 
1.Add jquery API [GOOGLE CDN or etc ]at the top of page [as shown in example]
   GOOGLE CDN - https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"

2.Add Grapdevs API at the very bottom of page or after the closing of <body> tag
   GrapDevs API - http://api.grapdevs.tech/js/grap-javascript-api.js"
    
3.Add class -> [grap-pendu-l] on the tag where you want to make a pendulum effect

Example -> <img class="grap-pendu-l" height="350px;"src="http://api.grapdevs.tech/logo.png">

<h4>AND THAT"S ALL ;-)</h4>
